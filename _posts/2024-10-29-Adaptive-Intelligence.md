Based on my understanding, adaptive intelligence refers to a continuously learning system with a "brain" that can absorb experiences from real-world actions. This brain consists of knowledge representations enriched through interactions with humans, other robots, and the environment. This approach aligns well with robot manipulation scenarios, where prediction errors from these interactions can automatically refine the system's forward models. I'm genuinely excited by this paradigm and eager to contribute to its development.

I believe knowledge-driven approaches are essentially another form of data-driven learning. To me, knowledge-driven refers to information that's easily summarized and transferred between human minds. However, I think reality is more complex. Humans attempt inductive reasoning under very specific conditions, but I prefer allowing robots to learn independently. While they may have a knowledge base, it might not be easily teachable to humans through text representations.
