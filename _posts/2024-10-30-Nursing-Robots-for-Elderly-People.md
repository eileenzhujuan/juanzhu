Despite the mature appearance of many nursing robots, they lack crucial features such as intelligence, emotional communication, learning feedback, and skin temperature sensitivity. Consequently, these robots are seldom used in healthcare settings. Japan faces similar challenges, where limited understanding of AI has led to a fear of automated robots—a significant hurdle to overcome.

What's the main challenge with rehabilitation and nursing robots? The key issue lies in the dynamic nature of caregiving. When interacting with frail or disabled individuals, robots must be personalized to meet specific needs. These robots need to address not only biological and psychological needs but also social and mental demands. For instance, when moving an elderly person from bed to wheelchair to bathroom, a robot must ensure proper breathing and handle the person's body gently to prevent fractures. This process is dynamic—robots must interact with both the environment and the patient. Currently, this poses a significant challenge. Most existing care robots are merely engineering products with limited medical care capabilities and adaptive abilities.

We could improve these robots in the following areas:

### Intrinsic safety

Intrinsic safety means the device or system is inherently safe by design—accidents should not occur even with incorrect manipulation or breakdowns. If a robot cannot ensure the intrinsic safety of elderly people, it's impractical. Intrinsic safety can help alleviate people's concerns about AI and robots.

### Personalized Adaptation

Empathy is crucial for developing a warm, healthcare-oriented robot. Only a personalized robot can truly respond to an individual's needs (emotional feelings aren't required at this stage), so each robot must be capable of personalized adaptation.

While personalized adaptation remains a significant challenge, one possible approach is interactive and adaptive learning from a fundamental intelligent basis (such as a pre-trained large language model or high-level rules).

### Medical Process Guidance

For a healthcare robot, operating without medical process guidance would be irresponsible. Robots can learn from these guidelines as prior experiences. This guidance can serve as a test set to evaluate robot performance in simulated scenarios. Any violation of these guidelines should be prohibited.
